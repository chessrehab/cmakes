operation <destination, <source>			(general opreation syntax)
mov ebp, esp						(move vaue from stack pointer esp to base pointer ebp)
sub esp, 0x8						(subtract from stac pointer esp value 8)
inc esp, 0x8						(increment value in stack pointer by 8)
cmp DWORD PTR [ebp-4], 0x9				(compares two values, first is base pointer ebp decreased by 4 againts 8, the result of comparison will be stored in one of the register flags)
j**							(jump instructions)
jle 8048393 <main+0x1f>					(jump to address 8048393 if the flag set by previous comparison is lss or equal, which is address of main function plus 31bytes)
jmp 80483a6 <main+0x32>					(jump uncoditionally to address 8043a6 which equals address f funtion main plus 50 bytes)
lea rax,[rbp-4]						(load effective address stored in RBP -4 to register RAX]
inc DWORD PTR[rax]					(increment value in register RAX by one)
